This Python script allows you to create invoices for your customers based on an input Excel file.

The script will read the input file, calculate the total amount due, and generate an invoice in PDF format. The invoice will include the customer name, invoice number, invoice date, and a list of items purchased with their quantities and prices. The invoice will also display the total amount.
